# AlwaysBeRunning #
Requires Modsenfree v0.1.0

##Instructions ##

While this mod is active, the player will always be running at full speed, including 
during conversations. 

This can lead so some unexpected side-effects that the player should be aware of.
- Be mindful of running off the edge of the screen. Some moments in the game lock the player 
  into a specific area not with hard boundaries, but with zones past which the player will 
  gradually come to a stop at the edge of the screen. While running full speed  it is possible 
  to run beyond the edge of the screen before coming to a stop, at which point player control
  is disabled until this localized story section is finished. This leaves the player, and 
  dialogue bubbles, stranded off the side of the screen while the scene plays out.
  
- When choosing to interact with an object in the scene, Alex will normally walk
  automatically toward the object to a set distance before interacting. With this mod active
  Alex may continually run in circles around the object, unable to get into position. 
  When this happens, hold down the interact/select button to bring Alex to a walking pace.
